# Pareto Front Analysis for Multi-Objective Catch Environment

## Overview

This report presents the Pareto front analysis for the multi-objective reinforcement learning in the Catch environment. The analysis shows the trade-off between two competing objectives:

1. **Close to Target**: Agents try to minimize their distance to the target
2. **Far from Others**: Agents try to maintain distance from other agents to avoid collisions

## Experiment Setup

- Number of policies evaluated: 15
- Number of episodes per policy: 1
- Maximum steps per episode: 50
- Random seed: 42

## Results

The Pareto front shows the trade-off between the two objectives. Each point represents a policy with different weights for the objectives.

### Pareto-Optimal Policies

The following policies were found to be Pareto-optimal:

| Policy | Weight (Close to Target) | Reward (Close to Target) | Reward (Far from Others) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | 0.0500 | -0.4241 | 13.5235 |
| 2 | 0.2143 | -0.3861 | 12.0536 |
| 3 | 0.3571 | -0.1874 | 10.0616 |
| 4 | 0.5000 | -0.1415 | 9.7481 |
| 5 | 0.7857 | 0.1086 | 5.1569 |
| 6 | 0.9500 | 0.1184 | 4.5667 |

## Analysis

The Pareto front demonstrates that there is a clear trade-off between the two objectives. Policies that perform well on one objective tend to perform worse on the other.

### Key Observations

1. Policies with high weights for "Close to Target" achieve better performance on that objective but sacrifice performance on "Far from Others"
2. Policies with balanced weights achieve moderate performance on both objectives
3. The shape of the Pareto front indicates that the objectives are conflicting

## Conclusion

This analysis shows that there is no single "best" policy for this environment. The choice of policy depends on the relative importance of each objective for the specific application.

For applications where safety is critical, policies that prioritize "Far from Others" may be preferred to avoid collisions. For applications where catching the target is the primary goal, policies that prioritize "Close to Target" may be more appropriate.
